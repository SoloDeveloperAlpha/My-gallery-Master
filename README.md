Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
- * You can see it on this page : https://my-gallery-master-eba71.web.app
- What was your experience?
- * Nothing special
- What have you learned/improved?
- * I used the same layout for various screen formats, but to do this I included rendering the html structure by shaping it with a GRID , that way it won't lose its shape unless you modify columns or rows.
- Your wisdom? 
- * I'm still improving HTML5 , CSS3 ,JAVASCRIPT
